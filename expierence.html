    <h3>Analytics Software Engineering Intern    </h3><br>
    <p>üìç CoinHeatMap | Jan 2025 ‚Äì April 2025    </p>
    <h4>Summary: </h4>
    <p>
        I developed a full-featured Solana Rich List and Wallet Analytics Dashboard that transforms blockchain data into real-time visual insights. Using React, D3.js, and Tailwind CSS, I integrated the Helius API to display live wallet balances via an interactive treemap. The dashboard analyzes inflows, outflows, and key transactions‚Äîoptimized for clarity and performance.

I emphasized clean, scalable code with reusable components, responsive design, and consistent UI styling. I also leveraged AI tools like ChatGPT to speed up development and streamline problem-solving, contributing to a polished MVP for investor demos.

I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where I can solve real-world problems and ship high-impact features. I‚Äôm passionate about building tools that help people understand data, and I‚Äôm excited to grow as a software engineer through challenging, hands-on experiences.
